At the start of the past summer, I saw a blog post about solo paddling, and decided that it would be a good idea to have a go. So one evening I packed up my kit and headed for my local home run, the Afon Lwyd. A not particularly picturesque river, weaving it's way through a series of brownfield sites and farms, it's an unpopulated Grade 2, with virtually no traffic.

On my previous attempt of the same stretch with my buddy Dan Law, I had a long swim (and a longer run) in a river swelled by two straight weeks of rain. This time, I was determined that it would be different. It was different, but not in the way I'd intended.

As I arrived at the get-on, I realised that this was not going to be a straightforward trip. What had been a clear path from the road to the river in January, had by May, gained a full season of growth. After climbing through the undergrowth, I found the usual seal launch to be a good deal further away from the water than usual. I'd misjudged the levels. This turned out to be a theme. As I made my way through the industrial estates of New Inn, Pontypool, and Cwmbran, the river continued to drop.

As I reached Cwmbran playing fields, I also realised that I wasn't moving as fast as intended. It was already time for me to be at the get-off, and I was only halfway down the river. This meant that as I neared the three-quarter point of the river, it got dark. Just as I was about to cut my losses and walk out to the nearest road, I fortunately found myself at the get-off.

As I got changed in the rapidly gathering darkness, I reflected on the run. Had it been fun? Yes. Had it been tiring? Yes. Did I learn anything on the river? Certainly. Always take everything into account when going paddling. You may have the ability and kit to run a river, but that doesn't always mean that you should.

Was it worth doing again? No freaking way.
