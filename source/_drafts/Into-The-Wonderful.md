From reading _Ready Player One_ (Review coming soon), I decided to take a look back on some of the games I played during my childhood.

One of my fondest memories was of "racing" the computer to be ready to play. Could I get changed out of my school uniform, get a drink and sit down in front of the screen before the desktop was responsive. I always won; a feat I don't think I'd be able to repeat today, going up against an SSD.

One of the earliest games I remember playing was _The Lion King_
