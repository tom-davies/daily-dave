From reading _Ready Player One_ (Review coming soon), I decided to take a look back on some of the games I played during my childhood.

One of my fondest memories was of "racing" the computer to be ready to play. Could I get changed out of my school uniform, get a drink and sit down in front of the screen before the desktop was responsive. I always won; a feat I don't think I'd be able to repeat today, going up against an SSD.

One of the earliest games I remember playing was _The Lion King_

One of the earliest games I remember playing was _The Lion King_ Made by Virgin Interactive in 1997 **check this**, it actually had quite a few versions, for the SNES, Amiga, MegaDrive and PC. It was also one of my first experiences of game piracy. _The Lion King_ used a common method of DRM which relied upon the user finding a particular page and line in the manual for the game, and inputting the word found there. The method my family used to bypass this was simply to photocopy the manual, so that anyone with the game had a copy to hand to start the game up. I played enough of the game to know all of the "passwords" as there was only a small set of them. When I came to play the game again recently to write about it, the only password I could remember was "Difficulty" so I had to repeatedly input that until I was granted access to the game.

The game held up to the lens of nostalgia, with the neat little secrets and minigames simply hidden behind 18 years of muscle memory. Some of the levels are as difficult as ever (I'm looking at you, Simba's Return)

One of the other games that I cut my teeth on was _Gods_. Released in 1991 for the Amiga and Atari ST by The Bitmap Brothers, it was ported to PC in 1992. The theme tune, "Into the Wonderful" as well as the game's background music was composed by Nation XII. Unfortunately I only ever heard the theme tune in my time with the game, as the background music was only available in the Console versions, or with a connected Roland sound card on PC.

In some of its thematic elements, it feels almost like an early 90s precursor to Dark Souls, with it's huge bosses, unforgiving gameplay, and relative neutrality of its protagonist "The Hero". It's a testament to its difficulty that over the course of about 10 years, I was the only member of my family to ever make it to the second of the game's four worlds.

I definitely spent far too much of my time playing _Gods_, as I was banned from it after having a nightmare featuring "The Hero" standing at the foot of my bed. Looking back on it, it's particularly interesting that it was the protagonist of the game that I felt was threatening me, rather than any of the horrifying enemies!

After the MS-DOS era, I spent a long time away from PC Gaming, until I played The Sims 2 on a PC that a family friend built for me. However, that experience was marred by the requirement to be constantly saving the game to avoid losing all progress to the constant restarting of the computer.
It wasn't really until 2011 that I really came back into the fold. That's a story for the future.
