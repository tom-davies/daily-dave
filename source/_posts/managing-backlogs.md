I've been struggling with one of the ultimate first world problems: Media backlog.<!--more--> I have so many things to watch/read/play that I get stuck not doing any of them. I an effort to combat this decision paralysis, I developed a plan.

1. Write a list of all the things I want to finish
2. Work out how long I have spent on each of them
3. Find the total length of the thing

   1. [How Long to Beat](www.howlongtobeat.com)
   2. [IMDB](imdb.com)
   3. [GoodReads](goodreads.co.uk)

4. Calculate % completion
5. Sort by % completion (decending)
6. DO IT!

I also think I will start splitting focus between one long thing (_Fallout 4_, _American Horror Story_,_The Lord of the Rings Trilogy_) and multiple short things (_Papo Y Yo_, _Philip K Dick's Electric Dreams_,_Science Fiction Short Stories_). Changing up the genres that I'm looking at will probably help!

Anyway, it's been nice to get back to the blog, maybe I'll be able to write about some of the experiences that I finally got around to completing!
