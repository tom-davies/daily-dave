I first played _Final Fantasy XII_ on the PS2 not long after it came out in 2009. Despite not finishing it at the time (A skill I have maintained with other games in the series), it is the entry that had the greatest impact on me. The setting of Ivalice, with its warring states and their associated aesthetics really drew me into their world. So when I heard that the remaster, _The Zodiac Age_ was going to be getting a PC release, I was over the moon! As soon as it arrived, I immediately committed an entire weekend to it.

# Combat

One of my favourite things about _FFXII_ was its departure from the overtly turn-based battle system of its predecessors. Replacing random encounters with dynamic enemies that moved around the map makes the game more tactical, with the decision of whether to fight left entirely to the player, rather than to the whims of RNGesus.

The introduction of the Gambit System, which effectively became the Active Time Battle (ATB) system of _FFXIII_ was another change that I welcomed. Being able to give your party members a list of options to work through leaves you as the player more able to focus on forward-planning, deciding when to begin direct action, for example to counteract a high damage incoming attack that your Gambits won't begin working on until it's too late.

The system is not completely realtime however, as commands still take time to execute. This allows you to queue an action behind the current one. This system also plays into the tactics of a battle, as using an item is almost instant with a small effect, whereas Magick has a casting time, but a greater effect.

# Zodiac Job System

A change brought in for _The Zodiac Age_ is one that was actually first seen in the PS2's _International Zodiac Job System_ version (only released in Japan, so not particularly International). This version introduced the "Zodiac Job System", which as the name may suggest, provides a set of 12 "Jobs" for your party.

The Job system was tweaked slightly for _The Zodiac Age_, with the ability to allocate a second job to each character. Now that all 12 of the Jobs on the board can be allocated to the characters, another layer has been added to the decisions that the player must make. It definitely helps to create a more rounded out party though: I don't think my Balthier would be of much use as a White Mage or an Archer, but as a dual role, I think it works really well!

The introduction of Jobs has also changed the way I think about party composition. As each Job can only be allocated to one character, parties are no longer about their characters, but their Jobs instead. I don't like Vaan as a character, but by God sometimes I really need a Black Mage! Square Enix carried this system over to _FFXIII_ with the Commando/Ravager/Synergist/etc. roles, but I think I prefer it here, where the roles can be combined in different, potentially more interesting ways.

# Quality of Life Improvements

_The Zodiac Age_ Also introduced some Quality of Life improvements, particularly people coming back for a replay. The "New Game +" and "New Game -" Modes are unlocked from the beginning of the game, and there's the addition of a dedicated "Fast Forward" button (R1/RB) to making any grinding or long running sections less of a faff!

One of the more interesting changes that have been added is also one of my favourites. Autosaves have now been added between areas. This has made the game much easier for me to "Pick up and Play", because I don't _have_ to commit hours to a playthrough working between two save crystals. I do still commit many hours to the game, but not for that reason!

# Guide Books

I played _FFXII_ with the Piggyback Guide Book the first time around, and I'm doing it again this time. In games as sprawling as the _Final Fantasy_ series I think it's important to have some amount of guidance, even if it's just to let you know when certain missable quests pop up so that you don't miss out on them.

_The Zodiac Age_ has some adjustments that make my old guide a little bit incorrect, particularly on rewards for hunts and quests, but it's still a pretty good guide, and better than the one on offer from Prima, which bundles all of the side-quests up in the end of the book, rather than neatly placed with their appropriate story points throughout the guide.

# Conclusion

All in all, _Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age_ is the definitive version, and will be my second ever completed _Final Fantasy_ game!
