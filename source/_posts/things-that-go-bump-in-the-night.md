In honor of the spookiest of holidays, I'm looking at a genre that I don't have the best experience with: Horror.

<!--more-->

Looking at my [backlog](/2017/10/24/managing-backlogs/), a large number of those titles are horror or horror-adjacent. The main reason for this is that I'm a huge scaredy-cat. When I started playing _Outlast_ on my own (during the day, with the lights on.) I got to the first jump scare, at which point I reflexively hit Alt-F4 and vowed to not touch that game again.

Since then, I have made a small amount of further progress. It's become something of a tradition between me and my housemates to play "Scare Games" together on the TV. This has the effect of diffusing the stress between 3-4 people, and when one person can't get past a particular part, the controller gets passed on to someone else.

One of the only horror games I have ever truly enjoyed, and used to enjoy going home at the end of the day to play was Creative Assembly's _Alien Isolation_. It was off the back of this game that I realised what my issue with horror has always been.

I can't deal with horror that is in any way close to real life. _Alien Isolation_ and _Dead Space_ are both enjoyable experiences because I don't live on a space station. _Outlast_ and _Resident Evil_ are not my idea of a good time, because I know of buildings that at least look like asylums, and I have visited forests not unlike the one featured in _Resident Evil 4_.

This issue of separating fact from fiction affects my enjoyment of horror films as well. _Paranormal Activity_ by virtue of being set in an ordinary suburban house, scared me sleepless for 2 weeks. _The Descent_ however, did not, as I have no desire to go on a deep caving trip, and so things down there can stay down there.

As it is almost halloween, maybe I will play some of these horror games to try to get through them. I might also try [streaming](http://twitch.tv/spaceman619) them, to get the coop scare-game thing without needing to get other people in the same place as me!
