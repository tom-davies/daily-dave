I just got done playing through the Hearts of Stone expansion for The Witcher 3, and I'm about to dive into Blood and Wine. It occurred to me that whilst I have been saying things to myself about the game throughout my playthrough, I might like to write them down, so here that goes:

# Graphics

Holy shit this game is beautiful. Even when the settings aren't at maximum, this game is unbelievably gorgeous. From the textures that make up everything, to the attention to detail in the grasses and plants that cover the world, this game has clearly been a labour of love for CD Projekt RED.

Despite some issues with nVidia's HairWorks technology (I have an AMD graphics card), the game runs at a pretty consistent 60 frames-per-second at a resolution of 1920x1080.

In comparison to this, Fallout 4 is not nearly as visually impressive, and still has issues with framerate, with the game dropping below 40 frames-per-second in city areas on my setup.

# Characters

Every character is a believable person, from the average merchant to vital story characters. This further enhances the world by packing it out with fully-voiced people who can hold conversations with Geralt. Many times, I've found myself covering every single option in a conversation, just to hear everything each person has to say.

The only downside I have noticed with the characters is a lack of Welsh voice actors. There are a few, most notably one in the Hearts of Stone expansion, who I think actually has a Cardiff accent, which was quite exciting to hear. That being said, it's truly refreshing to hear a game where almost no characters have American accents. The use of regional accents for Nilfgaard and Skellige are a nice addition, which really hammer home how different culture is in these locations that are relatively isolated from the main locations of Velen and Novigrad.

The character you spend the most time with is obviously Geralt of Rivia, the eponymous Witcher. In an enjoyable change from how most western RPGs handle player choice, rather than an obvious good-guy / bad-guy dichotomy, Geralt almost exclusively operates in shades of grey. There's a reasonable number of decisions which can be answered with variations on "I don't give a shit, do what you want." This makes for a much more interesting character, one which I associate much more closely with. There was no decision in the game where I remember thinking "There's no option that I would pick".

# Story

The story is alright but is the one place where I think the game falls a bit flat. Despite having a few really hard-hitting moments and revelations, it mas mostly forgettable. I never really felt like The Wild Hunt was a credible threat to anyone, except for one quest early in the game where you visit a village that The Wild Hunt has been through.
In my opinion, just experiencing the world was a better story and I would happily pay again to experience another world filled with new side-quests to complete.

The story of Hearts of Stone was significantly more interesting in my opinion. It might have been a wiser choice for the entire game to have played out in 10-15 hour chunks like that, with a series of complete arcs around more complex Witcher Contracts. Each "mini-campaign" could have multiple twists and turns, and may even have had effects upon other concurrent quests.

# Lore

This is possibly one of my favourite things about this game. Despite borrowing heavily from European folklore, the lore of The Witcher really steps it up a notch with the addition of mutations and the almost technological application of magic that mages and sorceresses harness.

It makes the more fantastical elements of the world easier to accept and leads to revelations that you can use to your advantage during gameplay. There's something really satisfying about picking the correct oil and/or signs to use on a brand new enemy because of their similarity to another monster that you understand how to defeat.

# Conclusion

I haven't even really touched on the gameplay systems of the game yet, and that might have to wait for another post.
I hope you can tell what I think of The Witcher 3 from this wall of text if not, then

# TLDR: YES
