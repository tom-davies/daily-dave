_In which I walk a lot and go to the most exclusive club in Europe._

Monday began with a hurried breakfast in the last 15 minutes available for it. Enough time though to chug two cups of coffee, two bowls of cereal and swipe enough fruit to count as lunch for the day.

From here, I headed out on the S-Bahn to the Zo√∂logischer Garten. I bought my tickets the night before online, and once my phone was up and running on O2-de I could use my unlimited 4G here as well.

I spent at least 5 hours wandering the Zoo, set in a park, and took around 500 pictures. Here are some of them:

Whilst I was out, I decided it would be a good idea to visit the Mecca of Techno, Berghain. Situated in an industrial area of East Berlin, it cuts an imposing figure.

The entire area has some very impressive graffiti, right down to the doors of the club itself.

That evening, I took a leaf out of Manchester's book and visited Berlin's take on Almost Famous Burger. _Mixtape_, near the Hansa-Viertel district of Berlin, has some quirky ideas for burger names, as each is named for a popular Hip-Hop track. I opted for the "Oh La La La". I was surprised when it turned out that my burger was actually a bagel! Another way they look to change it up!

No photo of the burger, but one of the beer instead.
