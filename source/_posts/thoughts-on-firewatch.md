[Firewatch](http://www.firewatchgame.com/) is not a long game. I played through it in two evenings, so my playthrough as a whole was probably around 5 hours. However, in these 5 hours I went through the pretty massive rollercoaster of the story line. <!--more-->Here I've decided to break down some of the parts that were particularly important to me.

# Procrastination

Procrastination is a state that is near and dear to my heart, and is something that is clearly embraced by Henry too. He spends the large majority of the game not watching for fires, even though that is literally his job. This is particularly highlighted by the game design, which teases you with the "Firefinder" in the centre of the room that is one of the first things you see as you enter the lookout. You will never touch it again throughout the entire game.

# Opening Dialogue

The use of the opening dialogue to set the scene was a very interesting move on the part of the developer. Based on a text based HTML game engine called [Twinery](http://twinery.org). it offers a choose-your-own adventure start to the game that is unobtrusive, and from a development standpoint is very low-cost. In fact, the developers actually use the tool to storyboard games without having to develop an engine, make artwork or any of the other requirements usually involved in game creation.

# Ending (OBVIOUSLY SPOILERS)

Much of the game's criticism is levelled at the ending. After an intense ramp upwards with a conspiracy, lost teenagers, a stalker, everything comes to a relative anti-climax. For a lot of people, this was a disappointment. For myself, however, it formed an excellent ending to the game.

Firewatch is intensely grounded in reality. To have a sudden supernatural or incredible force behind the events of the game would have been a shame and a massive thematic departure. By wrapping up the game with the story of a father hiding in the wilderness to avoid explaining the death of his son, a mirror is provided to Henry to possibly understand the effects that leaving his wife behind could have caused.

# Conclusions

Overall, I hugely enjoyed Firewatch, and look forward to experiencing the next project from Campo Santo!
