This morning, I listened to the latest episode of the podcast [_Rabbits_](rabbitspodcast.com) from [Minnow Beats Whale](minnowbeatswhale.com) and The [Public Radio Alliance](publicradioalliance.com). As the show or at least this season is coming to an end, I thought I'd write something about it.<!--more-->

I'm having a bit of a love/hate relationship with the show. Getting into an episode is a bit of a slog, but by the end of an episode, I am completely hooked, and then I have to wait two weeks for another episode.

I'm a fan of the production style, mixed together real-world and telephone conversations, told in a pretty thoroughly chronological way, and the concept, of an alternate reality game called _Rabbits_. That idea has taken the story down some unexpected avenues (theoretical physics, biochemical research, all that good stuff) whilst mostly not being so "out there" that it leaves the realms of possibility. Despite these elements keeping me hooked, and making sure I come back every fortnight, I'm not as impressed by some other aspects of the show.

Each episode feels as if it was written backwards, working from the excellent cliffhanger at the end of the episode, and then meandering back to the start for around an hour. This creates a pace that starts off very slowly, and rapidly comes to a head in the final 5 minutes of the episode. This pacing is then further disrupted by adverts that are inserted at semi-random parts of the show. Sometimes they seem placed to turn plot points into smaller cliffhangers, but often they just remind me that I'm listening to a work of fiction.

Another thing that takes me out of my suspended disbelief only really appeared in the most recent couple of episodes. Whilst trying to find further clues, which are implied to be very difficult to decode, the characters seem able to find the method almost instantly. I don't mind people being good at cracking codes, it makes them come across as able and intelligent. However, when they can pull these kinds of stunts

on a regular basis, it gets a bit ridiculous. I'd like to see some failures, multiple attempts or cooperation to find the result!

Since beginning this, I've started listening to another PRA show, [_TANIS_](tanispodcast.com). It has a similar production style to _Rabbits_, and whilst it has a character who can seemingly find clues wherever they are, it's not written in nearly as jarring a way. Also, there are three seasons of _TANIS_, so I can binge-listen to them on my commute for the next couple of weeks!

Overall, I would advise you to try _Rabbits_, at least for the first couple of episodes. It's a really interesting concept, and I'd love to see more productions like this come out in the future!
