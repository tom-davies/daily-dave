_In which I sit on a train for far too long, and remember how good German Railways are._

This journey begins, as they seldom do, on a Sunday. Due to unfortunate vehicular mishaps (Rob's car had a flat tire), I took a walk up to Oxford Road Station to get a train down to Manchester Airport.

This train journey was then hampered by the fact that Transpennine Express (God bless Privatised Rail) had managed to "misplace" two conductors. This resulted in two trains worth of people trying to fit onto one train. Fortunately, this gave me a chance to eavesdrop on a particularly interesting conversation between a parasitologist and a bioinformatist about data collection for TB trials. Eventually, the train arrived at the airport, and I was only slightly late to check in.

Once I got to the departure lounge, I promptly wolfed down a Full English Breakfast, and walked down to the gate. The rest of the journey was pretty mundane, although I did get the luxury of front row seats on the plane, with a quick glimpse into the cockpit at one point!

Once I landed at Berlin Schönefeld Airport, I headed straight to pick up a Weeks' Travel Ticket. At 37.20 (£33.41) it was a good deal cheaper than the similar offer for London (£58.60). I then hopped aboard the S-Bahn, and headed towards Berlin Hauptbahnhof (Hbf).

From the station, I took a 10 minute walk to my hostel and checked in. After dropping off all of my things, which consisted of exactly one bag, I headed back over to the Hbf to get some food. It's a seriously huge station, with 3 supermarkets, a Burger King, a Pizza Hut, and a seemingly infinite number of places to buy coffee.

I settled on a McDonalds, as my time spent travelling had taken it's toll on me. I sat on one of the benches near by, ate my food, and then headed to bed.

I only have a couple of photos from this first day, This one was taken around that corner from my Hostel.
