_In which I hurt myself in a museum and wait an inordinate amount of time for street food._<!--more-->

Today I visited the Computerspiele Museum. As someone who seriously enjoys video games, this place is a historical heaven! Despite ostensibly being only two rooms and a shop, the immense amount of content kept me interested for over 3 hours! The accurate depictions of different eras of gaming were especially interesting, as one appeared to be an exact replica of my old bedroom, right down to the metal floor!

I also discovered a new, potentially horrifying game, The PainStation... This game is Pong with a twist. To start the game, each player must place their hand on two buttons, and agree to what is about to happen. When either player misses a shot, there is a chance that the "ball" will hit a block behind the paddle, and deliver a "punishment" to the player. This could be an electric shock, an infrared burn, or a whip to the back of the hand.

As the game continues, the "punishments" become more severe, are delivered for longer periods of time, and the speed of the ball increases. The first player to remove their hand from the buttons loses the game.
This is the state of my hand after playing a single game.

Some people who know me may also know of something else I evangelise quite a lot, the Mechanical Keyboard. A lot of old games consoles were actually computers, complete with keyboards, and now I want replicas of the keys for mine.

I then went to pick up an SD card reader from Saturn. This place is possibly my favourite shop on the planet. It's an incredible mix of PC World, Curry's, Carphone Warehouse, And HMV all at once. This means that although I only went in for a cable, I ended up staying for far longer, and tried out VR with the HTC Vive. Whilst it wasn't a perfect experience, as there was no sound, it gave me a pretty good idea about how good the hardware is.

I then headed to the nearest coffee shop to go through the photos from the week. This also gave me the perfect chance to do some reading, something that I had been intending to do the entire time I had been in Berlin. I made a decent dent in _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep_ then started writing these blog posts, as I now had photos to go along with them.

After briefly heading back to the Hostel, I set off to find some food. An S-Bahn and a U-Bahn ride later, I walked up the station steps and directly into the queue for "The Best Kebab in the World"

After standing in this queue for an hour and a half (Pretty standard for that time of night, according to the people in the queue) I got what I had heard so many good things about. Unfortunately, I don't have a good picture, so this potato-quality one from my phone will have to do.

It was every bit as good as the rumours had made out. It has spoiled me for every single kebab I may ever have. There is nothing remotely this good in Britain, end of story.
