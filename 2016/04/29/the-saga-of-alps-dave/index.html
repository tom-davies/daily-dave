been really bad, and I felt that now was the right time to get some of my thoughts down on paper (or on the screen). I’m going to try to run through a brief history of my Brain.</p><h1 id="Act-1-The-Alps"><a href="#Act-1-The-Alps" class="headerlink" title="Act 1 / The Alps"></a>Act 1 / The Alps</h1><p>The first time I really noticed that something was up was in the Summer of 2014. I’d gone on a trip to the Alps with my University Canoe Club when things started to go downhill. It began as an all-encompassing apathy.</p><blockquote><p>“Do you want to come paddling?”<br>“No.”<br>“Do you want to come drinking?”<br>“No.”<br>“Do you want to go to the shops?”<br>“No.”<br>“What do you want to do?”<br>“No.”<br>Understandably this irritated the people around me, and soon it became so idiosyncratic that it was referred to as “Alps Dave”. I did very little paddling, and what paddling I did, I didn’t particularly enjoy.</p></blockquote><p>Upon returning to Britain, everything went back to normal, further cementing “Alps Dave” in club lore as a mythical beast no-one would ever want to meet. It wasn’t until almost six months later, that I realised that “Alps Dave” could be a medical condition.</p><p>I had been watching a lot of YouTube videos (as was my wont during my final year at university) and came across a few with some YouTubers that I was particularly fond of discussing their depression. Suddenly it clicked, and I realised that I was experiencing a number of things that they had discovered were symptoms. What followed was a few weeks of umm-ing and ahh-ing, deciding whether it was worth going to a doctor about, until eventually I did it.</p><p>What followed was a single test (the PHQ-9) where I ranked a series of feelings and actions from “Never” to “Every Day”. From this questionnaire, it was deduced that I had moderate depression. The diagnosis in and of itself was beneficial, as it gave me an explanation for a lot of things, (not wanting to socialise; worsening eating habits; procrastination to an expert degree) but I did start to use it as a bit of a crutch.</p><blockquote><p>“I can’t come out tonight, my depression is playing up”<br>“I’m depressed today, I’m not even going to try getting any work done.”<br>I began a course of medication, (10mg Citalopram, increased to 20mg after 2 weeks) and Cognitive Behavioural Training (CBT) sessions. This took the edge off. Some days were worse than others, but on the whole I felt better. The side effects were interesting. As someone who had been tired for about 18 months, it was very strange to be able to stay up all night.</p></blockquote><p>Fortunately, the week of side-effects coincided with a series of social events that I was able to attend, and even see though to the end. This week gave me my first taste of getting home after sunrise, and for that I am eternally grateful, although I am glad that I returned to a normal sleep schedule shortly after that.</p><h1 id="Act-2-Bolton"><a href="#Act-2-Bolton" class="headerlink" title="Act 2 / Bolton"></a>Act 2 / Bolton</h1><p>In June 2015, I graduated University. I was lucky enough to get a job, working for the company that I had been working for part-time during my final year. This meant that I could stay in the North for the forseeable future, and would not have to move away from friends, back to South Wales. In order to be what I thought would be “better” located for work, I moved from Manchester to Bolton.</p><p>For the first time, I was living alone. As an introvert, this was ideal. Spending time with people has always exhausted me, and finally having the chance to have a place of my own was genuinely exciting. However, it had its downsides. Bolton was not nearly as centrally located as I hoped, with a lot of my work taking place in South Manchester, Chester, and Wales. This led to a lot of very long commutes. It was also further from my friends than I had expected, and transport was significantly more difficult, with a number of train cancellations and road closures making socialising very hard.</p><p>I spent nearly 6 months alone in Bolton</p><p>Despite this, I spent most of that time depression-free. The excitement of work, and a new life without university gave me hope and a lot of energy. I’m sure the medication also helped. After my time my Bolton, I decided to move back to Manchester. Although I am still living alone, it is a lot easier to be sociable, with many people a walk, bus or taxi away, rather than needing to take a train. However, even with all of the people that I can get in touch with, whilst still having my own bubble, thing’s aren’t perfect.</p><p>The last month has been my worst episode of depression.</p><h1 id="Act-3-Manchester"><a href="#Act-3-Manchester" class="headerlink" title="Act 3 / Manchester"></a>Act 3 / Manchester</h1><p>Since leaving Bolton, my mental state has deteriorated. The apathy has returned, leading me to think that the Citalopram isn’t working any more. My mood has also started cycling rapidly. What this means is that I can go through a series of as many as 4 periods of low mood within a single day.</p><p>During this time, I also disclosed my mental health to work. This was done to mitigate any problems that might have come up in work, but it does not seem to have helped. The amount of driving I have been doing for work was getting to me, so I attempted to change my job to be more office based. This was unfortunately not possible. This also negatively affected my mood further.</p><p>My mood decreased to the point where I realised that I needed to see a doctor again. Speaking to a doctor was very beneficial. We agreed to increase my Citalopram dosage to 40mg for 2 months to see if that improves the situation. If it doesn’t, then that’s a sign to change my medication completely. They also encouraged me to sign up for more CBT sessions, which will hopefully be useful.</p><h1 id="Epilogue-Futures"><a href="#Epilogue-Futures" class="headerlink" title="Epilogue / Futures"></a>Epilogue / Futures</h1><p>Since I wrote this, things have improved. The 40mg Citalopram seems to be helping, or at least causing my mood to cycle less frequently. I’m still waiting for my CBT appointment, and I’m enjoying my job more.</p><p><em>All in all, it feels like there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and I’m inching my way towards it.</em></p></div></article></div><div id="footer-post-container"><div id="footer-post"><div id="nav-footer" style="display:none"><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/archives/">Writing</a></li><li><a href="https://tom-davi.es/steamgrid">Penguin Steam Grid</a></li></ul></div><div id="toc-footer" style="display:none"><ol class="toc"><li class="toc-item toc-level-1"><a class="toc-link" href="#Act-1-The-Alps"><span class="toc-number">1.</span> <span class="toc-text">Act 1 / The Alps</span></a></li><li class="toc-item toc-level-1"><a class="toc-link" href="#Act-2-Bolton"><span class="toc-number">2.</span> <span class="toc-text">Act 2 / Bolton</span></a></li><li class="toc-item toc-level-1"><a class="toc-link" href="#Act-3-Manchester"><span class="toc-number">3.</span> <span class="toc-text">Act 3 / Manchester</span></a></li><li class="toc-item toc-level-1"><a class="toc-link" href="#Epilogue-Futures"><span class="toc-number">4.</span> <span class="toc-text">Epilogue / Futures</span></a></li></ol></div><div id="share-footer" style="display:none"><ul><li><a class="icon" href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://blog.tom-davi.es/2016/04/29/the-saga-of-alps-dave/"><i class="fab fa-facebook fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li><li><a class="icon" href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https://blog.tom-davi.es/2016/04/29/the-saga-of-alps-dave/&text=The Saga of Alps Dave"><i class="fab fa-twitter fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li><li><a class="icon" href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://blog.tom-davi.es/2016/04/29/the-saga-of-alps-dave/&title=The Saga of Alps Dave"><i class="fab fa-linkedin fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li><li><a class="icon" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?url=https://blog.tom-davi.es/2016/04/29/the-saga-of-alps-dave/&is_video=false&description=The Saga of Alps Dave"><i class="fab fa-pinterest fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li><li><a class="icon" href="mailto:?subject=The Saga of Alps Dave&body=Check out this article: https://blog.tom-davi.es/2016/04/29/the-saga-of-alps-dave/"><i class="fas fa-envelope fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li><li><a class="icon" href="https://getpocket.com/save?url=https://blog.tom-davi.es/2016/04/29/the-saga-of-alps-dave/&title=The Saga of Alps Dave"><i class="fab fa-get-pocket fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li><li><a class="icon" href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://blog.tom-davi.es/2016/04/29/the-saga-of-alps-dave/&title=The Saga of Alps Dave"><i class="fab fa-reddit fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li><li><a class="icon" href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=https://blog.tom-davi.es/2016/04/29/the-saga-of-alps-dave/&title=The Saga of Alps Dave"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li><li><a class="icon" href="http://digg.com/submit?url=https://blog.tom-davi.es/2016/04/29/the-saga-of-alps-dave/&title=The Saga of Alps Dave"><i class="fab fa-digg fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li><li><a class="icon" href="http://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=https://blog.tom-davi.es/2016/04/29/the-saga-of-alps-dave/&name=The Saga of Alps Dave&description="><i class="fab fa-tumblr fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li></ul></div><div id="actions-footer"><a id="menu" class="icon" href="#" onclick="return $("#nav-footer").toggle(),!1"><i class="fas fa-bars fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> Menu</a> <a id="toc" class="icon" href="#" onclick="return $("#toc-footer").toggle(),!1"><i class="fas fa-list fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> TOC</a> <a id="share" class="icon" href="#" onclick="return $("#share-footer").toggle(),!1"><i class="fas fa-share-alt fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> Share</a> <a id="top" style="display:none" class="icon" href="#" onclick="$("html, body").animate({scrollTop:0},"fast")"><i class="fas fa-chevron-up fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> Top</a></div></div></div><footer id="footer"><div class="footer-left">Copyright © 2018 Tom Davies</div><div class="footer-right"><nav><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/archives/">Writing</a></li><li><a href="https://tom-davi.es/steamgrid">Penguin Steam Grid</a></li></ul></nav></div></footer><link rel="stylesheet" href="/lib/font-awesome/css/fontawesome-all.min.css"><link rel="stylesheet" href="/lib/justified-gallery/css/justifiedGallery.min.css"><script src="/lib/jquery/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/lib/justified-gallery/js/jquery.justifiedGallery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/main.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="/js/lazyload-plugin/lazyload.intersectionObserver.min.js"></script></body></html>
